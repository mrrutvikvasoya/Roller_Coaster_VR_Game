## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Unity (Version used: [Specify version])**
- **Meta Quest 2**
- **XR Plugin & Meta Quest 2 SDK**

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**
   from here https://git.oth-aw.de/a85d/arvr

2. **Open in Unity**
   - Launch Unity and open the project folder.
   - **Note:** The **Library** folder is not included here due to large file size. Unity will regenerate it.

3. **Import Dependencies**
   - Ensure all required Unity packages (XR Plugin, Meta Quest SDK) are installed.
   - If missing, install them via **Unity Package Manager**.

4. **Build and Run**
   - Connect **Meta Quest 2** to your PC.
   - Switch to **Android Platform** in Unity Build Settings.
   - Click **Build & Run** to deploy the app.

### First-Time Running
- The first run may take **extra time** as Unity compiles and optimizes assets.
- Subsequent runs will be **faster** due to cached resources.

## Known Issues (Bugs)
- **Sound Issues:** Audio distortion in high-speed sections.
- **Object Pickup:** Difficulty grabbing objects.
- **Movement Restrictions:** Players stuck while holding objects.
- **Boundary Glitches:** Players falling through edges in some cases.

## Future Improvements
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations.
- Multiplayer mode integration.
- Additional mini-games and expanded environments.
